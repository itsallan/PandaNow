>Hey there! I'm the developer behind PandaNow. I'm relatively new to app development, with about one year of experience under my belt. As such, I'm still learning a lot about **clean architecture** and best practices. If you're an experienced developer who knows a thing or two about building robust and scalable Android applications, your contributions to improve the project's architecture would be incredibly valuable and appreciated!
